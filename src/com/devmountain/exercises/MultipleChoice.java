    /*
    In this portion we will combine elements from all three exercises so far to create a simple Multiple Choice Question

    1)Begin by creating an entry point for your program below.

    2)Instantiate a variable called 'input' of type 'Scanner' and store a new instance of Scanner passing in System.in
    as an argument

    3) Print to the terminal using System.out.println() your first question you wish to ask.

    4) Create a new String variable named 'correctAnswer' and assign it to be a String containing the correct answer
    to your question

    5) Create a new String variable named 'answer' and store the next line from the input variable

    6) Using an if-else statement, evaluate the answer variable to see if it is correct and print out the corresponding
    message to the terminal
